'''TOPIC MODELING WITH GENSIM

url2 tutorial       https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/topic-modeling-gensim-python/
LDA                 LDAâ€™s approach to topic modeling is it considers each document as a 
                    collection of topics in a certain proportion. And each topic as a 
                    collection of keywords, again, in a certain proportion.               
                    Topic:  A topic is nothing but a collection of dominant keywords that 
                    are typical representatives. Just by looking at the keywords, 
                    you can identify what the topic is all about.
                    ** so it doesn't actually give you a topic but a group of colocated key words
                    that represent a topic. The reader must infer from these key words the
                    "meaning of the topic".

                me on this car I saw\nthe other day. It was a 2-door sports car, looked to be 
                from the late 60s\/\nearly 70s. It was called a Bricklin. The doors were really 
                small. In addition,\nthe front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. 
                This is \nall I know. If anyone can tellme a model name, engine specs, years\nof 
                production, where this car is made, history, or whatever info you\nhave on 
                this funky looking car, please e-mail.\n\nThanks,\n- IL\n
